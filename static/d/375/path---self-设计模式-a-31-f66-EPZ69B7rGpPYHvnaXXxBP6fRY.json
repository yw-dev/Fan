This isn't an exhaustive list, just some highlights.</p>\n<h2>Developer-friendly API</h2>\n<p>At its core Ghost is a self-consuming, RESTful JSON API with decoupled admin client and front-end. We provide lots of tooling to get a site running as quickly as possible, but at the end of the day it's <strong>Just JSON</strong> ™️, so if you want to use Ghost completely headless and write your own frontend or backend... you can!</p>\n<p>Equally, Ghost is heavily designed for performance. There are 2-5 frontpage stories on HackerNews at any given time that are served by Ghost. It handles scale with ease and doesn't fall over as a result of traffic spikes.</p>\n<h2>A serious editor</h2>\n<p>Ghost has the rich editor which every writer wants, but under the hood it delivers far more power than you would expect. All content is stored in a standardised JSON-based document storage format called MobileDoc, which includes support for extensible rich media objects called Cards.</p>\n<p>In simple terms you can think of it like having Slack integrations inside Medium's editor, stored sanely and fully accessible via API.</p>\n<h2>Custom site structures</h2>\n<p>Routing in Ghost is completely configurable based on your needs. Out of the box Ghost comes with a standard reverse chronological feed of posts with clean permalinks and basic pages, but that's easy to change.</p>\n<p>Whether you need a full <strong>multi-language site</strong> with <code class=\"language-text\">/en/</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">/de/</code> base URLs, or you want to build out specific directory structures for hierarchical data like <code class=\"language-text\">/europe/uk/london/</code> — Ghost's routing layer can be manipulated in any number of ways to achieve your use case.</p>\n<h2>Roles &#x26; permissions</h2>\n<p>Set up your site with sensible user roles and permissions built-in from the start.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Contributors:</strong> Can log in and write posts, but cannot publish.</li>\n<li><strong>Authors:</strong> Can create and publish new posts and tags.</li>\n<li><strong>Editors:</strong> Can invite, manage and edit authors and contributors.</li>\n<li><strong>Administrators:</strong> Have full permissions to edit all data and settings.</li>\n<li><strong>Owner:</strong> An admin who cannot be deleted + has access to billing details.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Custom themes</h2>\n<p>Ghost ships with a simple Handlebars.js front-end theme layer which is very straightforward to work with and surprisingly powerful. Many people stick with the default theme (<a href=\"https://demo.ghost.io\">live demo</a> / <a href=\"https://github.com/tryghost/casper\">source code</a>), which provides a clean magazine design - but this can be modified or entirely replaced.</p>\n<p>The Ghost <a href=\"https://marketplace.ghost.org\">Theme Marketplace</a> provides a selection of pre-made third-party themes which can be installed with ease. Of course you can also build your own <a href=\"/api/handlebars-themes/\">Handlebars Theme</a> or use a <a href=\"/api/\">different front-end</a> altogether.</p>\n<h2>Apps &#x26; integrations</h2>\n<p>Because Ghost is completely open source, built as a JSON API, has webhooks, and gives you full control over the front-end: It essentially integrates with absolutely everything. Some things are easier than others, but almost anything is possible with a little elbow grease. Or a metaphor more recent than 1803.</p>\n<p>You can browse our large <a href=\"/integrations/\">directory of integrations</a> with instructions, or build any manner of custom integration yourself by writing a little JavaScript and Markup to do whatever you want.</p>\n<p>You don't need janky broken plugins which slow your site down. Integrations are the modern way to achieve extended functionality with ease.</p>\n<h2>Search engine optimisation</h2>\n<p>Ghost comes with world-class SEO and everything you need to ensure that your content shows up in search indexes quickly and consistently.</p>\n<h4>No plugins needed</h4>\n<p>Ghost has all the fundamental technical SEO optimisations built directly into core, without any need to rely on third party plugins. It also has a far superior speed and pageload performance thanks to Node.js.</p>\n<h4>Automatic google XML sitemaps</h4>\n<p>Ghost will automatically generate and link to a complete Google sitemap including every page on your site, to make sure search engines are able to index every URL.</p>\n<h4>Automatic structured data + JSON-LD</h4>\n<p>Ghost generates <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/intro-structured-data\">JSON-LD</a> based structured metadata about your pages so that you don't have to rely on messy microformats in your markup to provide semantic context. Even if you change theme or front-end, your SEO remains perfectly intact. Ghost also adds automatic code for Facebook OpenGraph and Twitter Cards.</p>\n<h4>Canonical tags</h4>\n<p>Ghost automatically generates the correct <code class=\"language-text\">rel=&quot;canonical&quot;</code> tag for each post and page so that search engines always prioritise one true link.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>If you're curious to see more, check out the <a href=\"https://ghost.org/features/\">features page</a> on Ghost.org.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"2018-10-15","path":"/post-one","title":"Post Number One","tags":["C++","设计模式"],"type":"resource","typeID":"3","typeTitle":"资源","categores":"游戏","special":""}}],"tagName":"设计模式"}}
