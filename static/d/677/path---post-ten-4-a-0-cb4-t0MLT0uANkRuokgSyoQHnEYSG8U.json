This isn't an exhaustive list, just some highlights.</p>\n<h2>Developer-friendly API</h2>\n<p>At its core Ghost is a self-consuming, RESTful JSON API with decoupled admin client and front-end. We provide lots of tooling to get a site running as quickly as possible, but at the end of the day it's <strong>Just JSON</strong> ™️, so if you want to use Ghost completely headless and write your own frontend or backend... you can!</p>\n<p>Equally, Ghost is heavily designed for performance. There are 2-5 frontpage stories on HackerNews at any given time that are served by Ghost. It handles scale with ease and doesn't fall over as a result of traffic spikes.</p>\n<h2>A serious editor</h2>\n<p>Ghost has the rich editor which every writer wants, but under the hood it delivers far more power than you would expect. All content is stored in a standardised JSON-based document storage format called MobileDoc, which includes support for extensible rich media objects called Cards.</p>\n<p>In simple terms you can think of it like having Slack integrations inside Medium's editor, stored sanely and fully accessible via API.</p>\n<h2>Custom site structures</h2>\n<p>Routing in Ghost is completely configurable based on your needs. Out of the box Ghost comes with a standard reverse chronological feed of posts with clean permalinks and basic pages, but that's easy to change.</p>\n<p>Whether you need a full <strong>multi-language site</strong> with <code class=\"language-text\">/en/</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">/de/</code> base URLs, or you want to build out specific directory structures for hierarchical data like <code class=\"language-text\">/europe/uk/london/</code> — Ghost's routing layer can be manipulated in any number of ways to achieve your use case.</p>\n<h2>Roles &#x26; permissions</h2>\n<p>Set up your site with sensible user roles and permissions built-in from the start.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Contributors:</strong> Can log in and write posts, but cannot publish.</li>\n<li><strong>Authors:</strong> Can create and publish new posts and tags.</li>\n<li><strong>Editors:</strong> Can invite, manage and edit authors and contributors.</li>\n<li><strong>Administrators:</strong> Have full permissions to edit all data and settings.</li>\n<li><strong>Owner:</strong> An admin who cannot be deleted + has access to billing details.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Custom themes</h2>\n<p>Ghost ships with a simple Handlebars.js front-end theme layer which is very straightforward to work with and surprisingly powerful. Many people stick with the default theme (<a href=\"https://demo.ghost.io\">live demo</a> / <a href=\"https://github.com/tryghost/casper\">source code</a>), which provides a clean magazine design - but this can be modified or entirely replaced.</p>\n<p>The Ghost <a href=\"https://marketplace.ghost.org\">Theme Marketplace</a> provides a selection of pre-made third-party themes which can be installed with ease. Of course you can also build your own <a href=\"/api/handlebars-themes/\">Handlebars Theme</a> or use a <a href=\"/api/\">different front-end</a> altogether.</p>\n<h2>Apps &#x26; integrations</h2>\n<p>Because Ghost is completely open source, built as a JSON API, has webhooks, and gives you full control over the front-end: It essentially integrates with absolutely everything. Some things are easier than others, but almost anything is possible with a little elbow grease. Or a metaphor more recent than 1803.</p>\n<p>You can browse our large <a href=\"/integrations/\">directory of integrations</a> with instructions, or build any manner of custom integration yourself by writing a little JavaScript and Markup to do whatever you want.</p>\n<p>You don't need janky broken plugins which slow your site down. Integrations are the modern way to achieve extended functionality with ease.</p>\n<h2>Search engine optimisation</h2>\n<p>Ghost comes with world-class SEO and everything you need to ensure that your content shows up in search indexes quickly and consistently.</p>\n<h4>No plugins needed</h4>\n<p>Ghost has all the fundamental technical SEO optimisations built directly into core, without any need to rely on third party plugins. It also has a far superior speed and pageload performance thanks to Node.js.</p>\n<p>Ghost automatically generates the correct <code class=\"language-text\">rel=&quot;canonical&quot;</code> tag for each post and page so that search engines always prioritise one true link.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>If you're curious to see more, check out the <a href=\"https://ghost.org/features/\">features page</a> on Ghost.org.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"2018-10-23","path":"/post-nine","title":"Post Number Nine","tags":["JavaScript","React"],"type":"dev","typeID":"2","typeTitle":"技术杂谈","categores":"JavaScript","special":"JavaWeb开发系列"}},"next":{"id":"3963625b-e220-504b-a753-627d1d9a85a7","excerpt":"也许应用中最常用到的组件就是Link，可见其重要性。其实Link组件几乎与 标签完全一样，除了一点：Link组件可以感知到被激活的路由。我们称当前在界面上显示的路由为被激活的路由。 紧接上一小节，刚打开网页我们看到的是渲染后的App组件。如果想从App页面导航到Boys页面和Girls页面，就需要在App组件中创建一些导航。代码如下： // modules/App.js中\nimport React…","html":"<p>也许应用中最常用到的组件就是Link，可见其重要性。其实Link组件几乎与<a>标签完全一样，除了一点：Link组件可以感知到被激活的路由。我们称当前在界面上显示的路由为被激活的路由。</p>\n<p>紧接上一小节，刚打开网页我们看到的是渲染后的App组件。如果想从App页面导航到Boys页面和Girls页面，就需要在App组件中创建一些导航。代码如下：</p>\n<p>// modules/App.js中\nimport React from 'react'\nimport { Link } from 'react-router'</p>\n<p>export default React.createClass({\nrender() {\nreturn (\n<div>\n<h1>明星特区</h1>\n<ul role=\"nav\">\n<li><Link to=\"/boys\">男神</Link></li>\n<li><Link to=\"/girls\">女神</Link></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n)\n}\n})\n现在再去打包运行（方法见上一节，以后不再重复说了哈），点击访问测试，你会惊奇的发现，点链接、回退、前进，都正常工作了。这就是Link组件的用法。</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"2018-11-20","path":"/post-11-20","title":"Post 11 20","tags":["DirectX 12","C++"],"type":"dev","typeID":"2","typeTitle":"技术杂谈","categores":"DirectX 12","special":"Unreal Engine 4系列"}}}}
